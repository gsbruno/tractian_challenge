### Key Features
- Tree visualization of locations, assets, and components
- Real-time status monitoring (Operating, Alert, Unavailable)
- Sensor data tracking (Vibration, Energy consumption)
- Company-based asset organization

### Technical Details
- Clean Architecture principles
- Domain-driven design
- Type-safe error handling using tuples
- Extensible entity system for status and sensor types

### Improvements
- Add comments to the code to explain the purpose of each class and function
- Add tests and test it with a good coverage
- Make the filtering more efficient
- Give a better UI/UX
