# tractian_challenge

A Flutter application developed as a technical challenge for Tractian. The app provides a hierarchical view of assets and their components, allowing users to monitor the status and sensor data of industrial equipment.

### Key Features
- Tree visualization of locations, assets, and components
- Real-time status monitoring (Operating, Alert, Unavailable)
- Sensor data tracking (Vibration, Energy consumption)
- Company-based asset organization

### Technical Details
- Clean Architecture principles
- Domain-driven design
- Type-safe error handling using tuples
- Extensible entity system for status and sensor types
- Use of GetIt for dependency injection
- Isolate the UI from the business logic
- Uses a separate Isolate to fetch and filter the data

### Improvements
- Add comments to the code to explain the purpose of each class and function
- Add tests and test it with a good coverage
- Make the filtering more efficient
- Give a better UI/UX
- Make a refactoring to clean the code and improve the architecture
- Can improve a lot on the organization of the code.
- Structure the tree better to improve the performance.
